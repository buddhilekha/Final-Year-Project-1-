## Analyzing touristsâ€™ perception of hotel location: Text analytics using online reviews
This study explores tourists' perceptions of hotel locations in Sri Lanka by analyzing
online reviews from TripAdvisor, covering the period from August 2023 to August
2024. Through text analytics, it identifies location-related keywords influencing guest
satisfaction and clusters hotels by keywords, such as scenic attractions, urban life,
ecotourism and adventure travel, noise, transportation and accessibility, and relaxed
environments. By employing techniques like TF-IDF and Word2Vec, the research
derives essential location-related keywords and employs K-means clustering to
categorize hotels. The findings highlight specific location clusters valued by different
traveler types, helping hotels target their offerings to enhance customer satisfaction.
The study provides actionable insights for hoteliers to optimize marketing strategies
based on tourists' preferences, suggesting that online travel agencies could use these
findings to refine search algorithms.
